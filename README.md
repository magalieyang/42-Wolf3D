42's school Web project : "Wolf 3D"

A graphic project where you play a First person Labyrinth's simulator using RayCasting's method.

Maps are customizables, but all maps need to follows thoses rules:
    -3: WALL WHICH IS THE ARRIVAL. (optional)
    -2: WALL WHICH MAKES DAMAGE. (optional)
    -1: BASIC WALL
    -0: PRACTICABLE AREA.

    -At least one PRACIABLE AREA (0).
    -All maps need to be surrounding by WALLs (1, 2 or 3).

    For exemples:

      1 1 1
      1 0 3
      1 1 1

      1 1 2 2 1
      1 0 3 0 2
      1 0 0 0 1
      1 1 1 1 1

Use Arrows keys for moving the character, if the player hits a lava wall, he'll lose some HP. If he hurts too much, it will be a game over.
Use the "T" key for display or show textures.
